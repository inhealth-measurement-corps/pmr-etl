What I have done:
1, Change all connectin string so that we could connect the new database server.
2, Change some SQL statement because we use Microsoft SQL database instead of Mysql. For example, in combined.py file, use 'insert' and 
'update' statement instead of 'Replace into'. 
3, Replace NaN with None so that we could insert NULL to the new database. 
4, Make all python files running in my own laptop.

To do:
1, Make the patient_ID in the patient_info and historical_details corresponding.
2, Run Ambulation Algorithm successfully and make sure the input file and the output file is correct.
3, Final goal is to run all the codes automatically in the new server.
